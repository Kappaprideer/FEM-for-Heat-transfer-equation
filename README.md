# Solution of heat transfer equation using finite element method - project for Differential and Difference Equations Course.

The problem involves solving the following differential equation using the finite element method:

$(a(x)u'(x))'+b(x)u'(x)+c(x)u(x)=f(x)$

The file **Solution_of_equation** contains the derivation for the variational formulation.

The program generates the system of linear equations, solves the generated system of linear equations, and draws the solution graph. On the input program gets positive integer n (number of elements we will use in finite element method) and draws the function we try to find.
